# Facial_Keypoints_Detection
Use Conv Nets and Batch Norm to detect the locations of facial features, or keypoints, in images.

This project comes from a Kaggle contest called "Facial Keypoints Detection".

Facial_Keypoint_Detection.ipynb is the main file that walks through the creation, training, and testing of the conv net model.
