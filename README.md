# Facial_Keypoints_Detection
Use Conv Nets and Batch Norm to detect the locations of facial features, or keypoints, in images.

Facial_Keypoint_Detection.ipynb is the main file that walks through the creation, training, and testing of the conv net model.

This project comes from a Kaggle contest called "Facial Keypoints Detection".  Training and test data files can be downloaded using "kaggle competitions download -c facial-keypoints-detection".

My model was able to achieve a root mean squared error of 2.1 using 96x96 images.
